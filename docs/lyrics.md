# Lyrics by Scenes

## Act 1

### 1. Overture

The Overture is heard over images of a troupe preparing their version of the Passion Play. They arrive out inm the Israeli desert in a bus with a cross attached to the roof along with many other props. As the performers unload off of the bus you get a feeling of celebration so often attributed to the late 60s, early 70s. They costume themselves. When the overture exchos the '39 lashes', they remove the cross from the roof and when the overture breaks into a jubilant "Superstar", we are introduced to Jesus appearing from a pile of people... Could we start?

Instrumental: no lyrics

### 2. Heaven On Their Minds
```
JUDAS

My mind is clearer now.
At last all too well
I can see where we all soon will be.
If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be.

 Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This talk of God is true.

And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For we are getting much too loud.
(And our conquerors object
To another noisy sect)

And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far....

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind.
Too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes it's all gone sour.

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
C'mon, c'mon
He won't listen to me ...
C'mon, c'mon
He won't listen to me ...
```
### 3. What's The Buzz

```
APOSTLES

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening. (Repeat 8 times)

JESUS

Why should you want to know?
Don't you mind about the future?
Don't you try to think ahead?
Save tomorrow for tomorrow;
Think about today instead.

APOSTLES

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's happening. (Repeat many times)

JESUS

I could give you facts and figures.
Even give you plans and forecasts.
Even tell you where I'm going.

APOSTLES

When do we ride into Jerusalem? (Repeat many times)

JESUS

Why should you want to know?
Why are you obsessed with fighting
Times and fates you can't defy?
If you knew the path we're riding,
You'd understand it less than I.

APOSTLES

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's happening. (Repeat many times)

MARY MAGDALENE

Let me try to cool down your face a bit. (Repeat 5 times)

JESUS

Mary that is good,
While you prattle through your supper,
Where and when and who and how.
She alone has tried to give me
What I need right here and now.

APOSTLES

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's happening. (Repeat many times) 
```

### 4. Then We Are Decided

```
CAIAPHAS

We've been sitting on the fence for far too long.

ANNAS

Why let him upset us?
Caiaphas, let him be.
All those imbeciles will see,
He really doesn't matter.

CAIAPHAS

Jesus is important,
We've let him go his way before.
And while he starts a major war,
We theorize and chatter.

ANNAS

He's just another scripture thumping hack from Galilee.

CAIAPHAS

The difference is they call him King,
The difference frightens me!
What about the Romans?
When they see King Jesus crowned,
Do you think they'll stand around,
Cheering, and applauding?
What about our people?
If they see we've lost our nerve,
Don't you think that they deserve,
Something more rewarding.

ANNAS

They've got what they want,
They think so, anyway.
If he's what they want,
Why take their toy away?
He's a craze!

CAIAPHAS

Put yourself in my place,
I can hardly step aside.
Can not let my hands be tied.
I am law and order.
What about our priesthood?
Don't you see that we could fall?
If we are to last at all,
We can not be divided.

ANNAS

Then say so to the council,
But don't rely on subtlety.
Frighten them, or they won't see.

CAIAPHAS

Then we are decided?

ANNAS

Then we are decided. 

```
### 5. Strange Thing Mystifying
```
JUDAS

It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time on women of her kind.

SIMON

Hey, cool it man.

JUDAS

Yes, I can understand that she amuses,
But to let her kiss you, stroke your hair, that's hardly in your line.
It's not that I object to her profession,
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say.
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent.
hey only need a small excuse to put us all away.

JESUS

Who are you to criticise her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now.
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now.
If your slate is clean, then you can throw stones.
If your slate is not, then leave her alone.

I'm amazed that men like you can be so shallow, thick and slow
There is not a man among you who know or cares if I come or go.

ALL (save Judas and Jesus)

No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
No, you're wrong!
You're very wrong!
How can you say that?
How can you say that?
How can you say that?
How can you say that?

JESUS

Not one, not one of you! 
```

### 6. Everything's Alright
```
MARY MAGDALENE

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And we want you to sleep well tonight.
Let the world turn without you tonight.
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

MARY MAGDALENE

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh.
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight.

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

JUDAS

Woman your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor.
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more.
People who are hungry, people who are starving
They matter more than your feet and hair!

MARY MAGDALENE

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know

APOSTLES' WIVES and MARY

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

JESUS

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling.
Look at the good things you've got.
Think while you still have me!
Move while you still see me!
You'll be lost, and you'll be sorry when I'm gone.

MARY MAGDALENE

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead/
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes, and relax
Think of nothing tonight.

APOSTLES' WIVES

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

MARY MAGDALENE

Close your eyes, close your eyes, and relax 
```
### 7. This Jesus Must Die
```
PRIEST ONE

Good Caiaphas, the council waits for you.
The Pharisees and priests are here for you.

CAIAPHAS

Ah gentlemen, you know why we are here.
We've not much time, and quite a problem here

MOB (outside)

Hosanna! Superstar!
Hosanna! Superstar!
Hosanna! Superstar!
Hosanna! Superstar!

ANNAS

Listen to that howling mob of blockheads in the street!
A trick or two with lepers, and the whole town's on its feet.

ALL (inside)

He is dangerous!

MOB (outside)

Jesus Christ Superstar!

ALL (inside)

He is dangerous!

MOB (outside)

Tell us that you're who they say you are.

PRIEST TWO

The man is in town right now to whip up some support.

PRIEST THREE

A rabble rousing mission that I think we must abort.

ALL (inside)

He is dangerous!

MOB (outside)

Jesus Christ Superstar!

ALL (inside)

He is dangerous!

PRIEST TWO

Look Caiaphas, they're right outside our yard.

PRIEST THREE

Quick Caiaphas, go call the Roman guard.

CAIAPHAS

No, wait!
We need a more permanent solution to our problem.

ANNAS

What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?
Miracle wonderman, hero of fools.

PRIEST THREE

No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.

CAIAPHAS

One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.

ANNAS

We dare not leave him to his own devices.
His half-witted fans will get out of control.

PRIESTS

But how can we stop him?
His glamour increases
By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.

CAIAPHAS

I see bad things arising.
The crowd crown him king; which the Romans would ban.
I see blood and destruction,
Our elimination because of one man.
Blood and destruction because of one man.

ALL (inside)

Because, because, because of one man.

CAIAPHAS

Our elimination because of one man.

ALL (inside)

Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man.

PRIEST THREE

What then to do about this Jesus-mania?

ANNAS

Now how to we deal with a carpenter king?

PRIESTS

Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing?

CAIAPHAS

Fools, you have no perception!
The stake we are gambling are frighteningly high!
We must crush him completely,
So like John before him, this Jesus must die.
For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die.

ALL (inside)

Must die, must die, this Jesus must die.

CAIAPHAS

So like John before him, this Jesus must die.

ALL (inside)

Must die, must die, this Jesus must, Jesus must, Jesus must die! 
```

### 8. Hosanna
```
CROWD

Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna
Hey JC, JC won't you smile at me?
Sanna Hosanna
Hey Superstar

CAIAPHAS

Tell the rabble to be quiet, we anticipate a riot.
This common crowd, is much too loud.
Tell the mob who sing your song that they are fools and they are wrong.
They are a curse. They should disperse.

CROWD

Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna
Hey JC, JC you're alright by me
Sanna Hosanna
Hey Superstar

JESUS

Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd?
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting.
If every tongue were stilled
The noise would still continue.
The rocks and stone themselves would start to sing:

CROWD AND JESUS

Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna

CROWD (alone)

Hey JC, JC won't you fight for me?
Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar

JESUS

Sing me your songs,
But not for me alone.
Sing out for yourselves,
For you are bless-ed.
There is not one of you
Who can not win the kingdom.
The slow, the suffering,
The quick, the dead.

CROWD and JESUS

Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna

CROWD (alone)

Hey JC, JC won't you die for me?
Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar 
```
### 9. Simon Zealotes
```
CROWD

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved.

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved.

Jesus I am with you.
Touch me, touch me, Jesus.
Jesus I am on your side.
Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.

SIMON ZEALOTES

Christ, what more do you need to convince you
That you've made it, and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome who rape our country,
And who've terrorized our people for so long.

CROWD

Jesus I am with you.
Touch me, touch me, Jesus.
Jesus I am on your side.
Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God,
So tell me that I'm saved.

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God,
So tell me that I'm saved.

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?

So tell me that I'm saved.

Christ you know I love you.
Did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God,
So tell me that I'm saved.

Jesus I am with you.
Touch me, touch me, Jesus.
Jesus I am on your side.
Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.

SIMON ZEALOTES

There must be over fifty thousand
Screaming love and more for you.
And everyone of fifty thousand
Would do whatever you asked them to.

Keep them yelling their devotion,
But add a touch of hate at Rome.
You will rise to a greater power.
We will win ourselves a home.

You'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever
You'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever
You'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever
Forever Amen! Amen! Amen!
```
### 10. Poor Jerusalem
```
JESUS

Neither you, Simon, nor the fifty thousand,
Nor the Romans, nor the Jews,
Nor Judas, nor the twelve
Nor the priests, nor the scribes,
Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is,
Understand what glory is,
Understand at all,
Understand at all.
If you knew all that I knew, my poor Jerusalem,
You'd see the truth, but you close your eyes.
But you close your eyes.
While you live, your troubles are many, poor Jerusalem.
To conquer death, you only have to die.
You only have to die.
```
### 11. Pilate's Dream
```
PILATE

I dreamed I met a Galilean;
A most amazing man.
He had that look you very rarely find:
The haunting, hunted kind.
I asked him to say what had happened,
How it all began.
I asked again, he never said a word.
As if he hadn't heard.
And next, the room was full of wild and angry men.
They seemed to hate this man.
They fell on him, and then
Disappeared again.
Then I saw thousands of millions
Crying for this man.
And then I heard them mentioning my name,
And leaving me the blame.
```
### 12. The Temple
```
MONEYCHANGERS AND MERCHANTS

Roll on up Jerusalem,
Come on in Jerusalem,
Sunday here we go again,
Live in me Jerusalem.
Here you live Jerusalem,
Here you breathe Jerusalem,
While your temple still survives,
You at least are still alive.
I got things you won't believe,
Name your pleasure I will sell.
I can fix your wildest needs,
I got heaven and I got hell.
Roll on up, for my price is down.
Come on in for the best in town.
Take your pick of the finest wine.
Lay your bets on this bird of mine.
What you see is what you get.
No one's been disappointed yet.
Don't be scared give me a try,
There is nothing you can't buy.
Name your price, I got everything.
Hurry it's going fast.
Borrow cash on the finest terms.
Hurry now while stocks still last.

Roll on up Jerusalem,
Come on in Jerusalem,
Sunday here we go again,
Live in me Jerusalem.
Here you live Jerusalem,
Here you breathe Jerusalem,
While your temple still survives,
You at least are still alive.
I got things you won't believe,
Name your pleasure I will sell.
I can fix your wildest needs,

(fade, screaming)

JESUS

My temple should be a house of prayer,
But you have made it a den of thieves.
Get out! Get out!
```
### 13. Lepers
```
My time is almost through.
Little left to do.
After all, I've tried for three years.
Seems like thirty, seems like thirty.


CROWD

See my eyes, I can hardly see.
See me stand, I can hardly walk.
I believe you can make me whole.

See my tongue, I can hardly talk.
See my skin, I'm a mass of blood.
See my legs, I can hardly stand.

I believe you can make me well.
See my purse, I'm a poor, poor man.
Will you touch, will you mend me Christ?
Won't you touch, will you heal me Christ?
Will you kiss, you can cure me Christ?
Won't you kiss, won't you pay me Christ?

See my eyes, I can hardly see.
See me stand, I can hardly walk.
I believe you can make me whole.
See my tongue, I can hardly talk.
See my skin, I'm a mass of blood.
See my legs, I can hardly stand.
I believe you can make me well.
See my purse, I'm a poor, poor man.
Will you touch, will you mend me Christ?
Won't you touch, will you heal me Christ?
Will you kiss, you can cure me Christ?
Won't you kiss, won't you pay me Christ?

JESUS

There's too many of you...Don't push me.
There's too little of me...Don't crowd me.
 
Heal yourselves +
```
### 14. I Don't Know How To Love Him
```
MARY MAGDALENE

I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,
I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.
What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.

I never thought I'd come to this.
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.
I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.
I love him so.
```
### 15. Damned For All Time/Blood Money
```
JUDAS

Now if I help you, it matters that you see
These sordid kinda things are coming hard to me.
It's taken me some time to work out what to do.
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.

I came because I had to; I'm the one who saw.
Jesus can't control it like he did before.
And furthermore I know that Jesus thinks so too.
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.

Annas, you're a friend, a worldly man and wise.
Caiaphas, my friend, I know you sympathise.
Why are we the prophets? Why are we the ones
Who see the sad solution - know what must be done?
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm damned for all time.

ANNAS

Cut the protesting, forget the excuses.
We want information. Get up of the floor.

CAIAPHAS

We have the papers we need to arrest him.
You know his movements. We know the law.

ANNAS

Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded.

CAIAPHAS

We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail.
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him.

ANNAS

With no crowd around him.

CAIAPHAS

Then we can't fail.

JUDAS

I don't want your blood money!

CAIAPHAS

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good.

JUDAS

I don't need your blood money!

ANNAS

But you might as well take it. We think that you should.

CAIAPHAS

Think of the things you could do with that money,
Choose any charity - give to the poor.
We've noted your motives.
We've noted your feelings.
This isn't blood money - it's a ...

ANNAS

A fee.

CAIAPHAS

A fee nothing more.

JUDAS

On Thursday night you'll find him where you want him.
Far from the crowds, in the Garden of Gethsemane.

CHOIR

Well done Judas. Good old Judas.
```

## Act 2

### 1. The Last Supper
```
APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now, I can see the answers
'Till this evening is this morning, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JESUS

The end...is just a little harder, when brought about by friends.
For all you care, this wine could be my blood.
For all you care, this bread could be my body.
The end! This is my blood you drink.
This is my body you eat.
If you would remember me when you eat and drink.

I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.
Yes, I must be out of my head.
Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead.
One of you denies me.
One of you betrays me.

APOSTLES

No! Who would?! Impossible!

JESUS

Peter will deny my in just a few hours.
Three times will deny me,
And that's not all I see.
One of you here dining,
One of my twelve chosen
Will leave to betray me.

JUDAS

Cut the dramatics!
You know very well who.

JESUS

Why don't you go do it?

JUDAS

You want me to do it!

JESUS

Hurry, they are waiting.

JUDAS

If you knew why I do it

JESUS

I don't care why you do it!

JUDAS

To think I admired you.
Well now I despise you.

JESUS

You liar. You Judas.

JUDAS

You want me to do it!
What if I just stayed here
And ruined your ambition.
Christ you deserve it.

JESUS

Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.
Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,
'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll all talk about us when we've died.

JUDAS

You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,
Our ideals die around us and all because of you.
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.
A jaded mandarin,
A jaded mandarin,
Like a jaded, faded, faded, jaded, jaded mandarin.

JESUS

Get out they're waiting! Get out!
They're waiting, Oh, they are waiting for you!

JUDAS

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better if you had it planned...
Oh....

APOSTLES

Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JESUS

Will no one stay awake with me?
Peter, John, James?
Will none of you wait with me?
Peter, John, James?
```

### 2. Gethsemane (I Only Want To Say)
```
JESUS

I only want to say,
If there is a way,
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison.

Feel it burn me,
I have changed.
I'm not as sure, as when we started.
Then, I was inspired.
Now, I'm sad and tired.
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations,
Tried for three years, seems like thirty.
Could you ask as much from any other man?
But if I die,
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree.

I'd want to know, I'd want to know, My God,
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, My God,
Want to see, I'd want to see, My God,
Want to see, I'd want to see, My God,
Why I should die.
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done matter any more?

I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord,
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord,

If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,

Why should I die? Oh why should I die?
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain.
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die.
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why.

Alright, I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how I die!

Then I was inspired.
Now, I'm sad and tired.
After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety.
Why then am I scared to finish what I started,
What you started - I didn't start it.

God, thy will is hard,
But you hold every card.

I will drink your cup of poison.
Nail me to your cross and break me,

Bleed me, beat me,
Kill me.
Take me, now!
Before I change my mind.
```
### 3. The Arrest
```
JESUS

Judas, must you betray me with a kiss?

PETER

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's happening. (Repeat a few times)

PETER AND APOSTLES

What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening.
Hang on, Lord,
We're going to fight for you! (Repeat)

JESUS

Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over?
It was nice, but now it's gone.
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to fishing from now on.

CROWD

Tell me Christ how you feel tonight.
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved at all worth while?
Come with us to see Caiaphas.

You'll just love the High Priest's house.
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas.
You'll just die in the High Priest's house.
Come on God this is not like you.
Let us know what you're going to do.
You know what you're supporters feel;
You'll escape in the final reel.
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight.
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Come with us to see Caiaphas.
You'll just love the High Priest's house.
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas.
You'll just die in the High Priest's house.
Now we have him!
Now we have got him!
Now we have him!
Now we have got him!
Now we have him!
Now we have got him!
Now we have him!
Now we have got him!
Now we have him!
Now we have got him!

CAIAPHAS

Jesus, you must realize the serious charges facing you.
You say you're the Son of God in all your handouts,
Well, is it true?

JESUS

That's what you say, you say that I am.

ANNAS

There you have it gentlemen.
What more evidence do we need?
Judas, thank you for the victim.
Stay a while and you'll see him bleed!

CROWD

Now we have him!
Now we've got him! (Repeat 4 times)

Take him to Pilate! (Repeat 4 times)
```

### 4. Peter's Denial
```
MAID BY THE FIRE

I think I've seen you somewhere.
I remember.
You were with that man they took away.
I recognize your face.

PETER

You've got the wrong man lady.
I don't know him,
And I wasn't where he was tonight
Never near the place.

SOLDIER

That's strange, for I am sure I saw you with with him.
You were right by his side, and yet you denied.

PETER

I tell you I was never with him.

OLD MAN

But I saw you too.
He looked just like you.

PETER

I don't know him!

MARY MAGDALENE

Peter, don't you know what you have said.
You've gone and cut him dead.

PETER

I had to do it, don't you see?
Or else they'd go for me.

MARY MAGDALENE

It's what he told us you would do.
I wonder how he knew.
```

### 5. Pilate And Christ
```
PILATE

Who is this broken man, cluttering up my hallway?
Who is this unfortunate?

SOLDIER

Someone Christ,
King of the Jews.

PILATE

Oh, so this is Jesus Christ,
I am really quite surprised.
You look so small,
Not a king at all.
We all know that you are news,
But are you king?
King of the Jews?

JESUS

Your words, not mine.

PILATE

What do you mean by that?
That is not an answer.
You're deep in trouble friend,
Someone Christ,
King of the Jews.
How can someone in your state be so cool about his fate?
An amazing thing, this silent king.
Since you come from Galilee, then you need not come to me,
You're Herod's race!
You're Herod's case!

MOB

Hey Ho Sanna Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Ho and how
Hey J.C., J.C. please explain to me,
You had everything.
Where is it now?
```
### 6. King Herod's Song (Try It And See)
```
HEROD

Jesus, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face.
You've been getting quite a name all around the place.
Healing cripples, raising from the dead.
And now I understand you're God,
At least, that's what you've said.

So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're divine; change my water into wine.
That's all you need do, then I'll know it's all true.
Come on, King of the Jews.

Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here.
You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year.
Oh what a pity if it's all a lie.
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you tried.

So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my swimming pool.
If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free.
Come on, King of the Jews.

I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.

So, if you are the Christ, yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread.
You can do it on your head.
Or has something gone wrong. Jesus, why do you take so long?
Oh come on, King of the Jews.

Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?
Mr. Wonderful Christ?
You're a joke. You're not the Lord.
You are nothing but a fraud.
Take him away.
He's got nothing to say!
Get out you King of the,
Get out King of the,
Oh get out you King of the Jews!
Get out of here!
Get out of here you,
Get out of my life.
```
### 7. Could We Start Again Please?
```
MARY MAGDALENE

I've been living to see you.
Dying to see you, but it shouldn't be like this.
This was unexpected,
What do I do now?
Could we start again please?
I've been very hopeful, so far.
Now for the first time, I think we're going wrong.
Hurry up and tell me,
This is just a dream.
Oh could we start again please?

PETER

I think you've made your point now.
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home.
Before it gets too frightening,
We ought to call a vote,
So could we start again please?

ALL

I've been living to see you.
Dying to see you, but it shouldn't be like this.
This was unexpected,
What do I do now?
Could we start again please?
I think you've made your point now.
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home.
Before it gets too frightening,
We ought to call a vote,
So could we start again please?
Could we start again please? (Repeat 5 times)

MARY MAGDALENE

Could we start again?
```
### 8. Judas' Death
```
JUDAS

My God! I saw him.
He looked three-quarters dead!
And he was so bad I had to turn my head.
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good.
I'd save him all this suffering if I could.
Don't believe...our good...
And I'd save him if I could...

ANNAS

Cut the confessions, forget the excuses.
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse.
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance.
The mob turned against him, you backed the right horse.

CAIAPHAS

What you have done will be the saving of everyone.
You'll be remembered forever for this.
And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts.
Pretty good wages for one little kiss.

JUDAS

Christ, I know you can't hear me,
But I only did what you wanted me too.
Christ, I'd sell out the nation,
For I have been saddled with the murder of you.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud!
I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
He is not a king. He is just the same
As anyone I know.
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?
My mind is in darkness.
God, God I'm sick. I've been used,
And you knew all the time.
God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.
You're so bloody, Christ.

CHOIR

Poor old Judas. So long Judas.

JUDAS

You have murdered me.
```
### 9. Trial Before Pilate
```
PILATE

And so the king is once again my guest.
And why is this? Was Herod unimpressed?

CAIAPHAS

We turn to Rome to sentence Nazareth.
We have no law to put a man to death.
We need him crucified.
It's all you have to do.
We need him crucified.
It's all you have to do.

PILATE

Talk to me Jesus Christ.
You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten by your own people.
Do you have the first idea why you deserve it?
Listen King of the Jews,
Where is your kingdom?
Look at me. Am I a Jew?

JESUS

I have no kingdom in this world.
I'm through.
There may be a kingdom for me somewhere.
If you only knew.

PILATE

Then you are a king?

JESUS

It's you that say I am.
I look for truth and find that I get damned.

PILATE

But what is truth?
Is truth a changing law?
We both have truths.
Are mine the same as yours?

MOB

Crucify him! Crucify him!

PILATE

What do you mean?
You'd crucify your king?

MOB

We have no king but Caesar!

PILATE

He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

MOB

We have no king but Caesar!
Crucify him!

PILATE

What is this new respect for Caesar?
'Till now this has been noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus? Why is he different?
You choose Messiahs by the sackfull.

MOB

We need him crucified,
It's all you have to do.
We need him crucified,
It's all you have to do.

PILATE

Talk to me, Jesus Christ.
Look at your Jesus Christ.
I'll agree he's mad.
Ought to be locked up,
But that is not a reason to destroy him.
He's a sad little man.
Not a King or God.
Not a thief,
I need a crime!

MOB

Crucify him!

PILATE

Behold a man,
Behold your shattered King.

MOB

We have no King but Caesar.

PILATE

You hypocrites,
You hate us more than him.

MOB 

We have no King but Caesar,
Crucify him!

PILATE

I see no reason. I find no evil.
This man is harmless, so why does he upset you?
He's just misguided, thinks he's important,
But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him.

MOB

Crucify him! Crucify him!

(Thirty-nine lashes, Pilate counts)

one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen forteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six stwenty-even twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty thirty-one thirty-two thirty-three thirty-four thirty-five thirty-six thirty-seven thirty-eight thirty-nine

PILATE

Where are you from, Jesus?
What do you want, Jesus?
Tell me.
You've got to be careful.
You could be dead soon,
Could well be.
Why do you not speak when
I hold your life in my hands?
How can you stay quiet?
I don't believe you understand.

JESUS

You have nothing in your hands.
Any power you have, comes to you from far beyond.
Everything is fixed, and you can't change it.

PILATE

You're a fool Jesus Christ.
How can I help you?

MOB

Pilate, Crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You have a duty
To keep the peace, so crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You have a duty
To keep the peace, so crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You have a duty
To keep the peace, so crucify him!

Remember Caesar.
You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Crucify him!

PILATE

Don't let me stop your great self-destruction.
Die if you want to, you misguided martyr.
I wash my hands of your demolition.
Die if you want to you innocent puppet!
```
### 10. Superstar
```
VOICE OF JUDAS

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.

You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned.
Why'd you choose such a backward time in such a strange land?
If you'd come today you could have reached a whole nation.
Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication.
Don't you get me wrong.
I only want to know.

CHOIR

Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ Superstar,
Do you think you're what they say you are?

VOICE OF JUDAS

Tell me what you think about your friends at the top.
Who'd you think besides yourself's the pick of the crop?
Buddha, was he where it's at? Is he where you are?
Could Mohammed move a mountain, or was that just PR?


Did you mean to die like that? Was that a mistake, or
Did you know your messy death would be a record breaker?
Don't you get me wrong.
I only want to know.

CHOIR

Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?
Jesus Christ Superstar,
Do you think you're what they say you are?
(Repeat many times)
```
### 11. The Crucifixion
```
JESUS

Father forgive them.
They don't know what they're doing.
My God, my God, why have you forgotten me?
Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit.
```


### 12. John Nineteen: Forty-One

"At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid."
